# MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture

![MVC IMAGE](assets/MVC3.png)


MVC is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. Here's a brief overview of each component:

### Model
- The Model represents the data and business logic of the application.
- It encapsulates the application's data and behaviors that manipulate that data.
- Changes in the Model trigger updates in the View.

### View
- The View is responsible for presenting data to the user.
- It displays the Model's data and provides an interface for user interaction.
- Views receive updates from the Model and reflect changes accordingly.

### Controller
- The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
- It receives input from the user via the View and processes it.
- It updates the Model based on user actions and updates the View to reflect changes in the Model.

### Advantages of MVC:
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVC separates the application logic into distinct components, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Modularity**: Each component can be developed, tested, and modified independently, promoting code reusability.
- **Scalability**: MVC supports the development of large and complex applications by organizing code into manageable parts.
- **Testability**: The separation of concerns facilitates unit testing of individual components, improving overall code quality.

MVC is widely used in web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET MVC, as well as in desktop and mobile application development.
