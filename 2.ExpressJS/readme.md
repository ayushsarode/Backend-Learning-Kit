# What is Express.js?

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web and mobile applications. It is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node-based web applications.

## Why Express.js?

### Simple and Minimalistic

Express.js is minimal and unopinionated, allowing developers the flexibility to structure their applications as they see fit. It doesn't impose strict guidelines or structures on the developer, making it a great choice for projects of varying sizes.

### Middleware Support

Express.js has a robust middleware system that allows you to extend the functionality of your application. You can use existing middleware or create custom middleware to handle specific tasks such as authentication, logging, and more.

### Routing

Express.js provides a simple and expressive way to define routes for your application. Routing allows you to map HTTP methods and URLs to specific controller functions, making it easy to organize and manage your application's endpoints.

### Server-Side Rendering and API Support

Express.js can be used for server-side rendering of views or as a backend API server. It provides a solid foundation for building both traditional multi-page applications and modern single-page applications.
