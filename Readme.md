# Node.js Learning Kit

Node.js is a powerful and popular JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for building scalable, high-performance network applications. In this README, we will cover the basics of Node.js, including its architecture, installation, and some essential concepts.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is well-known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it ideal for building scalable and real-time applications. Some key features of Node.js include:

- Asynchronous and event-driven I/O.
- Single-threaded but uses event loops to handle concurrency.
- Fast and efficient, thanks to the V8 JavaScript engine.
- A vast ecosystem of packages and libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager).

## How Node.js is Built

Node.js is built on the following key components:

1. **V8 JavaScript Engine:** Node.js uses Google's V8 engine to execute JavaScript. V8 compiles JavaScript into machine code, making it highly performant.

2. **Libuv:** This library provides the event loop and handles I/O operations asynchronously. It's responsible for Node.js' non-blocking and event-driven nature.

3. **Core Libraries:** Node.js comes with a set of core libraries for handling various tasks like file I/O, networking, and more.

4. **npm (Node Package Manager):** Node.js has a package manager (npm) for installing and managing third-party libraries and modules.
